# \_: “My Data Links” app
[Picture-It-Dictionary ("PicDict")](Picture-It-Dictionary.md) \| "My Data Links"

App - for (saving) your data/information and connections, links of things in it.

(it was "connections of data" - Connections of data you have/create)

To-do (for me):
 - a file, save some data to/in it.
   - printing, to app, to it - from anything!
