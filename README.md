# \_: “My Data Links” app
[Picture-It-Dictionary ("PicDict")](Picture-It-Dictionary.md) \| "My Data Links"

App - for connections, links of things in your data/information.

It was "connections of data" (Connections of data you have/create).

To-do (for me):
 - a file, save some data to/in it.
   - printing, to app, to it - from anything!
