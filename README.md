# _info_ to have... app

`info_to_have` \| [Picture-It-Dictionary ("PicDict")](#picture-it-dictionary-picdict)

This is _going to be_ an app to **help to do and make (things) with data/information**  
\- _saving it_ to your device to have, _searching_ for connections, links of things in it.

**EXAMPLES**:
1. Webpage is saved from Chrome browser to (a file in) _info_to_have_.  
   You get a word that links 2 "pieces" in that information, from the app.
2. Printing data to (a file in) the app.

## "JSON for any Data Inside It" file format
(filename extension: ".into.json")

```json
{
  "_type_": ".into.json - JSON for any Data Inside It",
  "_data_": "[JSON-LD, XML markup, CSV ... as JSON syntax.]"
}
```

To-do, for me:
 - (data) file formats - JavaScript Object Notation, ".into.json"
 - A file, save some data to/in it. Printing to it from anywhere, https://developer.android.com/reference/android/printservice/PrintService?hl=en#print-jobs
 - UI - user "interaction space"
 - [Google Knowledge Graph Search API ??](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph)

## Picture It Dictionary ("PicDict")

_Going to be_ an app for communication. The user:

1. imagines/pictures a concept/noun
2. draws _vector graphics_ image(s) - _Scalable Vector Graphics shape editing. Write to file?_
3. searches words and definitions for the image(s), explores results - _noun (3D) image parts - text properties, categories. Wikidata data_
