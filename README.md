# \_info_ to have, do, make with - app
[Picture-It-Dictionary ("PicDict")](Picture-It-Dictionary.md) \| "\_info_toHave"

App for **saving data/information to your device** to have, do, make (things)  
with - and to search for connections, links of things in that data.

(it was "connections of data" - Connections of data you have/create)

EXAMPLES:
1. Info (webpage) is saved from Chrome browser to _info_toHave / MyDataLinks.
2. You get a word that links 2 "pieces" in that info, from the app.

To-do (for me):
 - (data) file formats - JavaScript Object Notation / XML (markup language), CSV?
 - a file, save some data to/in it.
   - printing, to app, to it - from anything!
